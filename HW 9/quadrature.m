% Section 001, Exercise 5.4.1

% The function of this program is to provide a quadrature rule derived from a
% general formula seen in the book (exercise 8). It uses appropriate
% weights w and function evaluations of the integrand f and its first
% derivative f' at the lower and upper bounds of integration a and b,
% respectively. This is used to approximate the value of the integral of f
% over the interval [a, b].

function integral = quadrature(f, a, b)
    % input f: integrand (function)
    % input a: lower bound of integration
    % input b: upper bound of integration
