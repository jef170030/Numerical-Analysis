% Section 001, Problem 4.2.2

% The objective of this program is to find a 20'th degree interpolating
% polynomial p(x) using two sets of different Chebyshev nodes for the function 
% f(x) = (x^2 + 1)^(-1) on the interval [-5, 5]. Then using 41 equally-spaced
% points in the same interval of [-5, 5], we'll observe the values of 
% f(x) and p(x), and their discrepancy.
