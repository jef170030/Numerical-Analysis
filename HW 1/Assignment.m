% Section 001, Problem 1.2.21 parts c. and d.

% The function of the programs that follow - both parts c. and d. - is to
% show what values certain assignment statements would produce and what is
% wrong with a section of pseudocode, respectively. Hence, assignment
% statements will be used and the incorrect code will be written exactly as
% shown in the book.

% Part c.
x = 10/3
i = int16(x + 1/2)
half = 1/2
j = int16(half)
c = (5/9) * (f - 32)
f = 9/5 * c + 32

% Part d
radius = 1
area = (22/7)*(radius)^2
circum = 2*(3.1416)*radius
